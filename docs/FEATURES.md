# phpBB Studio - Dice

Are you a :scroll: RPG enthousiast? A role playing master :prince:?
Then we've got just the rolls for you!
We have created a comprehensive dice roller extension that is flawlessly integrated into phpBB's native system.
Your users can throw dice within your forums and let the story continue in new directions.
All this while you as an Administrator are in control.
We have taken all precautions to make sure users can not manipulate their dice rolls into the desired outcome.
A custom PHP class was created to make sure all calculations are done “behind the scenes”.
And an additional way to gain more control over the individual rolls is done by mimicing the native attachment system.
